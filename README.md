# MPC-FLIPM
A project whose goal is to apply an MPC strategy on the Flexible Linear Inverted Pendulum.

The work is based on the papers "Intrinsically Stable MPC for Humanoid Gait Generation" by N. Scianca, M. Cognetti, D. De Simone, L. Lanari, G. Oriolo, 
and "Boundedness Approach to Gait Planning for the Flexible Linear Inverted Pendulum Model" by Leonardo Lanari, Oliver Urbann, Seth Hutchinson, Ingmar Schwarz.
